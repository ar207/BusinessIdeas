You have a couple of options here. \nThe first is to use your own money, which has the benefit of allowing you to keep more of your profits.\n (Don’t worry—the amount of cash removed will be matched to you in a payment from the ATM user.) \nThe obvious risks of this involve the need to carry and stock a ten thousand rupeesor more at a time in your ATM, which might invite theft.\n Another option is to use a cash service, which you’ll pay a fee in exchange for them handling the restocking of your ATM and providing cash to fill it.\n This will eat into your profits more, but will also insulate you against the risk of being the victim of a robbery. ]]></string>
